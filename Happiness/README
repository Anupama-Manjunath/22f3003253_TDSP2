# README: Analysis of Happiness Dataset

## Data Description
The `happiness.csv` file contains data from the World Happiness Report. Key columns include:
- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Happiness Score**: A score reflecting perceived happiness levels.
- **GDP per Capita**: Economic performance of the country.
- **Social Support**: Community and social network strength.
- **Life Expectancy**: Average life expectancy in years.
- **Freedom**: Perception of freedom to make life choices.
- **Generosity**: Average willingness to help others.

## Analysis Carried Out
The analysis included:
1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Exploring relationships between happiness and economic, social, and health metrics.
2. **Regional Trends**:
   - Comparing happiness scores by region.
3. **Regression Modeling**:
   - Predicting happiness scores using socio-economic variables.

## Key Insights
- **Strong Predictors**: GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy are the strongest predictors of happiness.
- **Regional Disparities**: Nordic countries consistently score higher than global averages, while regions with political instability score lower.
- **Freedom and Generosity**: While these factors contribute positively, their impact is less pronounced than economic and health metrics.

## Implications
These insights suggest:
- Policymakers should prioritize investments in social support and healthcare to improve happiness.
- Targeted interventions in low-scoring regions could address specific deficits like freedom or social support.
- Future research could explore cultural influences on happiness beyond quantitative metrics.
